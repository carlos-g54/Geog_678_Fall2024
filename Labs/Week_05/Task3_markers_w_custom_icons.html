  <!--Next, you need to tell your HTML to access the Leaflet JavaScript library and its associated CSS stylesheet.

  <!--The first step is to define your map options and create the map object itself. There are a variety of default
   mapOptions you can set; here we simply choose the center of the map, its initial zoom, and its max zoom level.
    Any other Leaflet codes belong inside of the JS script tag-->
<script>
    var mapOptions = {
 center: [51.496294, -0.093126], //set center Lat/Long of your area of interest
 zoom: 15, //set initial zoom level
 maxZoom : 24,  //set max zoom level
 tap : false //fix popup bug on Safari
 }

//Creates map object according to map options
var map = new L.map('map', mapOptions);

//Example of an externally called basemap_ This loads the tileLayer from Esri:
//var Esri_WorldImagery = L.tileLayer('https://server.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}', {
//			attribution: 'Tiles &copy; Esri &mdash; Source: Esri, i-cubed, USDA, USGS, AEX, GeoEye, Getmapping, Aerogrid, IGN, IGP, UPR-EGP, and the GIS User Community'});

//Esri_WorldImagery.addTo(map);


//Load the basemap as a tilelayer from Openstreemap.
L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    maxZoom: 19,
    attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a>'
}).addTo(map);

//Letâ€™s create a green leaf icon. The URL is used, but a local file can be used as well.
var greenIcon = L.icon({
    iconUrl: 'https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-green.png',
    shadowUrl: 'https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-shadow.png',

    iconSize:     [38, 95], // size of the icon
    shadowSize:   [50, 64], // size of the shadow
    iconAnchor:   [22, 94], // point of the icon which will correspond to marker's location
    shadowAnchor: [4, 62],  // the same for the shadow
    popupAnchor:  [-3, -76] // point from which the popup should open relative to the iconAnchor
});

//Defining an icon class

var LeafIcon = L.Icon.extend({
    options: {
        shadowUrl: 'https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-shadow.png',
        iconSize:     [38, 95],
        shadowSize:   [50, 64],
        iconAnchor:   [22, 94],
        shadowAnchor: [4, 62],
        popupAnchor:  [-3, -76]
    }
});

//Now we can create all three of our leaf icons from this class and use them:

var greenIcon = new LeafIcon({iconUrl: 'https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-green.png'}),
    redIcon = new LeafIcon({iconUrl: 'https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-red.png'}),
    orangeIcon = new LeafIcon({iconUrl: 'https://leafletjs.com/examples/custom-icons/leaf-orange.png'});

//Adding marker to map.

L.marker([51.5, -0.09], {icon: greenIcon}).addTo(map).bindPopup("I am a green leaf.");
L.marker([51.495, -0.083], {icon: redIcon}).addTo(map).bindPopup("I am a red leaf.");
L.marker([51.49, -0.1], {icon: orangeIcon}).addTo(map).bindPopup("I am an orange leaf.");


//On click pop up returns lat long.
function onMapClick(e) {
    alert("You clicked the map at " + e.latlng);
}

map.on('click', onMapClick);
